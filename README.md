# SS13WebMap
=====

This is a small web-map for OracleStation based off of the GoonHub code (They are fine with it, I checked)

Currently the only map on here is Oracle's version of Omega, But I plan to add more maps, maybe even other maps from other codebases. (Para, TG, VG, Yog, ETC)

If you have an issues or suggestions, Feel free to make PRs or issues.
